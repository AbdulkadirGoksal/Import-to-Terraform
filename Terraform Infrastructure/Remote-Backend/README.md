# Standard Terraform backends:

- AWS S3 Backend (often paired with DynamoDB for state locking)
- Google Cloud Storage Backend
- Azure Storage Backend

Most backends support collaboration features, making them essential for ensuring secure storage and facilitating teamwork. While not all features need to be configured, we'll cover key aspects such as versioning, encryption, and state locking.

# Standard Backend - S3

# Step 1 - Create S3 Bucket and Validate Terraform Configuration
Ensure you have previously set up an S3 bucket to centralize your Terraform state remotely. If not, follow the steps outlined in the previous lab. If already completed, proceed to the next step.

# Step 2 - Validate State on S3 Backend
Verify that you can authenticate to your Terraform backend and access the information in the state file. Confirm that your configuration correctly points to the designated bucket and path.

# Example terraform.tf configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "bucket_name"
    key    = "file_path_in_Bucket"
    region = "us-east-2"
  }
}
```

# Step 3 - Enable Versioning on S3 Bucket
The S3 backend supports versioning, so every revision of your state file is stored. You can enable versioning manually on AWS S3 Bucket configurations.

# Step 4 - Enable Encryption on S3 Bucket 
 Store Terraform state in a backend that supports encryption. Many backends support encryption, ensuring that your state files are encrypted both in transit (e.g., via TLS) and on disk (e.g., via AES-256). The S3 backend supports encryption, which alleviates concerns about storing sensitive data in state files.

Example updated terraform.tf configuration with encryption enabled:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "bucket_name"
    key    = "file_path_in_Bucket"
    region = "us-east-2"
   # encrypt       = true
  }
}
```

# Step 5 - Enable Locking for S3 Backend --> DynamoDB 
The S3 backend supports state locking and consistency checking via DynamoDB to prevent concurrent modifications that could cause corruption. Follow these steps to enable locking:

# Create a DynamoDB Table: Create a DynamoDB table in your AWS account.

Update S3 Backend Configuration: Update your terraform.tf configuration to use the newly created DynamoDB table for locking:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "bucket_name"
    key    = "file_path_in_Bucket"
    region = "us-east-2"
   # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"  # Replace with your DynamoDB table name
   # encrypt       = true
  }
}
```
